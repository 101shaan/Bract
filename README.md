# Prism ⚡

> A blazingly fast, memory-safe systems programming language that compiles to native machine code

**Status:** 🚧 Early Development

## What is Prism?

Prism is a modern systems programming language designed for **speed**, **safety**, and **clarity**. It combines the performance of C/Rust with the expressiveness of modern languages, featuring:

- ⚡ **Lightning-fast compilation** to native machine code
- 🛡️ **Memory safety** without garbage collection
- 🔍 **Powerful type inference** - write less, get more
- 📦 **Built-in package management**
- 🔄 **Zero-cost abstractions**
- 🎯 **Excellent error messages**

## Quick Example

```prism
// Coming soon! Language syntax in active development
fn main() {
    println("Hello, Prism! ⚡")
}
```

## Project Goals

- **Rapid compilation** - compile large projects in seconds
- **Readable code** - clear syntax that doesn't sacrifice performance  
- **Modern features** - pattern matching, async/await, pipe operators
- **Excellent tooling** - VS Code extension, language server, debugger
- **Zero dependencies** - single binary compiler

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Language ✅ In Progress
- [x] Project setup
- [ ] Lexer/Tokenizer
- [ ] Parser & AST
- [ ] Type system foundations
- [ ] Basic interpreter

### Phase 2: Compilation
- [ ] Code generation (C transpilation)
- [ ] Native machine code compilation
- [ ] Optimization passes
- [ ] Error diagnostics

### Phase 3: Tooling
- [ ] VS Code extension
- [ ] Language Server Protocol (LSP)
- [ ] Package manager
- [ ] Standard library

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Async/await
- [ ] Pattern matching
- [ ] Memory management system
- [ ] Concurrency primitives

## Building from Source

**Prerequisites:**
- Rust 1.70+ (for compiler development)
- LLVM 15+ (for code generation)
- Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prism-lang
cd prism-lang
cargo build --release
```

## Contributing

Prism is in very early development. Contributions are welcome!

- 🐛 **Bug reports** - Open an issue
- 💡 **Feature suggestions** - Start a discussion
- 🔧 **Code contributions** - Submit a PR

## Language Design Philosophy

**Fast by default** - Performance shouldn't be an afterthought
**Safe by default** - Memory safety without runtime overhead  
**Clear by default** - Code should read like well-written prose
**Composable** - Small pieces that work together beautifully
