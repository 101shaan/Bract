STEP 1: Language Specification Design
Cursor Request:
I'm creating a new programming language called Prism that needs to be:
- Blazingly fast compilation to native machine code
- Memory safe without garbage collection  
- Readable syntax (not cryptic)
- Modern features like pattern matching, type inference
- Zero-cost abstractions

Design the complete language specification including:
1. Basic syntax for variables, functions, control flow
2. Type system (static typing with inference)
3. Memory management approach (ownership/borrowing or ref counting)
4. Module system and imports
5. Error handling mechanism
6. Basic operators and expressions
7. Function definitions and calls
8. Data structures (structs, enums, arrays)
9. Pattern matching syntax
10. Comments and documentation

Create a comprehensive LANGUAGE_SPEC.md file with examples for each feature. Make it readable but not verbose. Focus on clarity and performance-oriented design choices.


STEP 2: Formal Grammar Definition
Cursor Request:

Based on the Prism language specification, create a complete formal grammar in EBNF (Extended Backus-Naur Form) notation that covers:

1. Lexical grammar (tokens, keywords, operators, literals)
2. Expression grammar (arithmetic, logical, function calls, method calls)
3. Statement grammar (assignments, control flow, declarations)
4. Type grammar (basic types, generics, function types)
5. Module grammar (imports, exports, module declarations)
6. Pattern matching grammar
7. Function and struct definitions
8. Comments and whitespace handling

Save this as GRAMMAR.md. Make sure the grammar is unambiguous and suitable for recursive descent parsing. Include precedence rules for operators and associativity.


STEP 3: Compiler Architecture Design
Cursor Request:

Design the complete architecture for the Prism compiler optimized for fast compilation speeds. Create ARCHITECTURE.md that includes:

1. Overall compiler pipeline (lexer â†’ parser â†’ semantic analysis â†’ codegen â†’ linking)
2. Data structures for AST nodes (all expression types, statement types, declarations)
3. Symbol table design and scope management
4. Type checking and inference system architecture
5. Error reporting and diagnostics system
6. Code generation strategy (initially transpile to C, later LLVM IR)
7. Optimization passes to include
8. Memory management for compiler itself
9. Incremental compilation strategy
10. Parallel compilation approach
11. File organization and module structure for the compiler codebase

Make it detailed enough that we can implement each component systematically. Focus on performance and maintainability.

PHASE 2: LEXER & TOKENIZER
STEP 4: Complete Lexer Implementation
Cursor Request:
Implement a complete lexer/tokenizer for the Prism language in Rust. Based on the grammar we defined, create:

1. Complete Token enum with all token types (keywords, operators, literals, identifiers, etc.)
2. Lexer struct with position tracking (line, column, file)
3. Tokenization methods for:
   - All keywords (fn, let, if, else, match, struct, enum, etc.)
   - All operators (+, -, *, /, ==, !=, &&, ||, etc.)
   - String literals (with escape sequences)
   - Number literals (integers, floats, different bases)
   - Identifiers and type names
   - Comments (single-line and multi-line)
   - Whitespace handling
4. Error handling for invalid tokens
5. Position tracking for error reporting
6. Comprehensive test suite covering all token types
7. Performance optimizations (efficient string handling)

Create src/lexer.rs with full implementation. Make it robust and fast - this is the foundation of compilation speed.

STEP 5: Lexer Testing & Refinement
Cursor Request:
Create comprehensive tests for the Prism lexer and fix any issues. Generate:

1. Unit tests for each token type
2. Integration tests with real Prism code samples
3. Error handling tests (invalid characters, unterminated strings, etc.)
4. Performance benchmarks for large files
5. Edge case tests (Unicode identifiers, very long tokens, etc.)
6. Position tracking accuracy tests

Also create a simple CLI tool that can tokenize Prism files and output the token stream for debugging. Put tests in tests/lexer_tests.rs and the CLI tool in src/bin/prism_lex.rs.
