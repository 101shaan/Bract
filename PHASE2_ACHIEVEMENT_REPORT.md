# Phase 2 Status Report

## Current State

Phase 2 memory integration features are implemented and functional. The language can parse and analyze memory annotations, but there's still cleanup work needed.

### Working Features
- `@memory` and `@performance` annotation parsing works correctly
- `LinearPtr<T>`, `SmartPtr<T>`, `RegionPtr<T>` wrapper types parse and type-check
- Memory strategy integration flows through semantic analysis pipeline
- Cranelift code generation produces native output

### Test Results
```
test parser::memory_syntax::tests::test_strategy_wrapper_type ... ok
test parser::memory_syntax::tests::test_memory_annotation_basic ... ok
test parser::memory_syntax::tests::test_memory_annotation_multiple_params ... ok
test parser::memory_syntax::tests::test_invalid_strategy ... ok
```

Compilation pipeline is functional - parses bract files and generates native code through Cranelift.

### Current Issues
- 26 compiler warnings (unused imports, variables, dead code)
- Some incomplete runtime function implementations
- Missing validation for edge cases in memory strategy interactions

## Technical Implementation

The memory strategy system works through these stages:
1. Lexer recognizes `@` tokens for memory annotations
2. Parser converts `@memory(strategy = "linear")` to AST annotation nodes
3. Semantic analyzer validates strategy usage and tracks ownership
4. BIR lowering generates strategy-aware intermediate representation
5. Cranelift backend emits appropriate memory management calls

The implementation handles the 5 memory strategies (stack, linear, region, manual, smartptr) with different cost models and safety guarantees.

## Next Steps

Need to:
1. Clean up the 26 compiler warnings 
2. Complete runtime function implementations
3. Add comprehensive integration tests
4. Validate real-world usage patterns

The foundation is solid but needs polish before considering it production-ready.
